# Decisions

## 2026-08-03 — Target iOS 17+

SwiftData and the selected SwiftUI APIs provide the simplest local-first foundation without compatibility layers.

## 2026-08-03 — Preserve enum values explicitly

Persistent models store enum raw values and expose computed typed properties. Unknown values can fall back safely, and migrations remain visible.

## 2026-08-03 — Repository owns all persistent mutations

Feature views use `@Query` for observed reads, but creation, updates, lifecycle changes, and deletion go through `ThoughtRepository`. This keeps write logic independently testable.

## 2026-08-03 — One item per manual capture in Phase 1

Phase 1 does no organization. Each text capture creates one item linked to one session. The one-to-many relationship is already prepared for future splitting.

## 2026-08-03 — Keep completed items recoverable

Completed items leave Today but remain in Inbox until archived, so accidental completion can be reversed without adding another screen.

## 2026-08-03 — Archive is reversible; delete is confirmed

Archive is the normal removal path. Permanent deletion is available only in the editor and requires explicit confirmation.

## 2026-08-03 — No external dependencies

The first milestone uses only Apple frameworks. This limits setup, privacy exposure, and early architectural uncertainty.

## 2026-08-03 — Voice is the default capture mode

The central waveform opens an immersive voice-first screen. Typing remains one visible action away and receives partial transcription whenever recognition fails.

## 2026-08-03 — External capture stays system-native

Back Tap runs a composed Shortcut containing Dictate Text and Speak It’s Save Thought App Intent. This preserves the user’s current context instead of opening the app solely to display a custom animation.

## 2026-08-03 — One capture implementation across surfaces

In-app text, in-app voice, Siri, and Shortcuts all write through `SwiftDataThoughtRepository` and preserve capture source plus original wording.

## 2026-08-03 — Two destinations plus a capture dock

The permanent Capture tab was replaced with a signature central pulse between Today and Inbox. Capture is an action, not a database destination.

## 2026-08-11 — Lock Screen Today shows counts, not task names, by default

The Today widget now offers the accessory families, so it renders on the Lock Screen, which anyone holding a locked iPhone can read. Task names are therefore hidden there unless the user turns on "Show task names on the Lock Screen" in Account & Settings. The choice is published inside `SharedTodaySnapshot`, so the widget extension has a single source of truth and needs no second cross-process preference. Home Screen families are unaffected and always show names.

## 2026-08-11 — Lock Screen Today opens the app instead of completing in place

Home Screen families keep their interactive completion buttons. The accessory families are glance-and-tap only: they open `speakit://today`. A pocket mistap on a locked phone must not silently finish a task.

## 2026-08-11 — The Today snapshot uses the same protection class as the store

`SharedTodayStore` wrote its snapshot with `completeFileProtectionUnlessOpen`, which permits writes while the device is locked but refuses new reads until unlock. Lock Screen widgets and background timeline reloads both read while locked, so that class produced a false "All clear". The snapshot now uses `completeFileProtectionUntilFirstUserAuthentication`, matching what SwiftData already uses for the primary store, so it is not weaker than the source of truth it summarizes.

## 2026-08-11 — The dock follows the scroll view, not a gesture

Dock visibility used to be inferred from a `DragGesture` layered over the scroll surface with `.simultaneousGesture`. That was wrong twice over. It hid the dock on screens with nothing to scroll, because the finger moved even when the content could not. And because it judged the finger rather than the content, ordinary swipes had to satisfy its axis and distance rules to count — an arcing thumb was written off as a row swipe, and any wobble reset the accumulated travel — so the screen felt like it was ignoring real swipes.

`MemoryDockScrollTracker` and its gesture are gone. `DockScrollPolicy` now reads the scroll view's own position: iOS 18 and later through `onScrollGeometryChange`, and iOS 17 through a geometry anchor on the first row, where a recycled anchor means the list is unambiguously past the top. Content that cannot move reports nothing, so a short screen can never hide the dock no matter how the swipe is thrown; `.scrollBounceBehavior(.basedOnSize)` keeps rubber-banding from faking movement. The dock hides after 56 pt of continuous downward scrolling, returns after 36 pt back up, and is always present within 24 pt of the top, including when momentum carries the list home with no finger on screen.

Nothing now competes with the scroll view for the drag, which is the point: swiping the list is the system's job, not the app's.

## 2026-08-11 — Today rows dropped custom swipe-to-complete

Removing the dock gesture fixed part of the problem, but swipes that began on a row still failed, and rows cover most of the screen. `SwipeActionRow` layered its own `DragGesture` on every Today row. Measured on an iPhone 17 simulator: a 221 pt vertical swipe starting on a row title moved the list zero points, twice in a row, while a 160 pt swipe starting on empty background scrolled with momentum. Swipes starting on ordinary `Button`s — the black card, section headers, the completion circle — always scrolled, so the drag gesture was the only offender. Raising its activation distance from 12 pt to 28 pt let the scroll through, but that only converts a reliable failure into an intermittent one, which is what "sometimes buggy" already meant.

The gesture is gone. The reveal it offered was a shortcut for the completion circle that is already visible on every row, so no action became unreachable, and Memory, Inbox, and the completed log keep their native `List` `.swipeActions`, which arbitrate correctly because UIKit owns them. Restoring the shortcut on Today means a native mechanism — moving those sections into a `List`, or a UIKit pan recognizer that refuses to begin on vertical movement — not another SwiftUI gesture over the scroll view.

## 2026-08-12 — Needs review names the missing input instead of flagging it

Every row in Today's "Needs review" section read the same hedge: "Tap to confirm, split, or change the time". The section could tell a person that something was wrong with three items without telling them what, so clearing it meant opening each one to find out.

Rows now name the gap — "Needs a time", "Needs a person", "Task or note?", "Might be 2 thoughts", "Needs confirmation" — and the editor puts a red `*` beside the one field that answers it, with a banner naming the ask. The asterisk is deliberately not on the row: `*` is form convention for a field you must fill on this screen, and the review row is a link to a different screen. Naming the gap is what makes the section scannable; the asterisk is what makes the editor navigable once you are there.

`speakWarning` is the first chromatic token in an otherwise monochrome palette, and is reserved for exactly this meaning: this item is waiting on input from you. It is muted rather than alert-red so a section holding several rows still reads calm, and clears 4.5:1 on `speakSurface` in both appearances.

Filling the field flips "Needs clarification" off automatically. Supplying the missing input is the entire reason a person opens a flagged item, so leaving them to find the toggle — and leaving the item in Needs review if they did not — would have undone the point of naming the gap. The flip is one-directional and visible in the toggle, and the banner resolves to "Ready to save" so nothing about the form contradicts itself.

`ClarificationRequirement` is derived from the item's fields at read time, not recorded when extraction flags the item. See KNOWN_ISSUES.md — persisting the reason is the better end state and needs a schema version.

## 2026-08-14 — A reminder is whatever the person asked for, phrased any way

"Give me a reminder to message Catherine in one hour" produced a note in Memory › Reference with no date and no notification. The cause was narrow literal matching: typing looked for a sentence starting with `remind me`, and reminder delivery looked for the substring `"remind me"`. The noun form — "give me a reminder", "set a reminder", "I need a reminder", "reminder to…" — matched neither, so the capture fell through to `.note`, which is a Memory type that Today never shows and `ReminderScheduleRequest` never schedules. It was not one bad phrase; it was every phrasing that names the reminder instead of commanding it.

`ReminderPhrasing` in `ThoughtOrganizer.swift` is now the single source of truth for both forms, and the three places that used to carry their own copy — the action-body strip that decides an item's type, the timing parser that decides delivery, and `ReminderCopy` that writes the row title and notification body — all read from it. One definition means a phrasing cannot be understood by one of them and missed by another, which is exactly how the reported bug was shaped.

Behind that sits a structural guarantee, because phrase matching will always have gaps. A time the person committed to now makes an item actionable regardless of its type: `ThoughtOrganizer` promotes a non-actionable type to `.task` when timing resolved a reminder, and `CapturedItem.belongsInToday` / `belongsInMemory` are written as exact complements of each other, so no live item can land in both destinations or in neither. Wording we cannot read costs a good title, never a lost notification.

A reminder resolving into the past ("tonight", said at 11pm) now asks for a time instead of saving one. iOS drops a past-dated notification silently, so the previous behavior was an item that looked scheduled and could never fire.

## 2026-08-14 — Day rollover is derived, never migrated

Today's sections are computed from a live reference clock, not stored in the items. Crossing local midnight therefore re-sorts the screen with no write, no churn, and nothing to undo if the clock was wrong — a scheduled sweep that rewrote `dueDate` at midnight would mutate user data on a timer, and a device asleep at midnight would miss it.

`referenceNow` is refreshed from four signals because none subsumes the others: a 60-second timer while the app is awake, `NSCalendarDayChanged` for the precise local-day boundary, `significantTimeChange` for carrier time and DST, and `scenePhase == .active` so a device that slept across midnight is correct before the first frame. `completedToday` reads the same clock as the sections so the whole screen agrees on which day it is.

Reminder notifications now pin `TimeZone.current` into their `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` components. Without it iOS re-reads those wall-clock components in whatever zone the device is in at fire time, so travelling would move the notification off the instant the item's own date describes, and Today and the notification would disagree.

## 2026-08-14 — Ten free captures, once

The free allowance no longer renews monthly. `FreePlanAllowance.lifetimeCaptureLimit` is a one-time total: a person tries the whole product, then decides whether it is worth paying for, rather than waiting out a reset. This also resolves a mismatch flagged in `Website/README.md`, where the site already advertised "ten captures to try" while the app shipped a monthly ration.

The migration is non-destructive and one-directional. The `SpeakIt.freePeriodStartedAt` storage key is unchanged and `normalizedUsage` now only clamps, so an install that used its captures under the monthly plan keeps that count instead of being handed ten more, and a clock moved backwards cannot mint a fresh allowance.

## 2026-08-14 — Classification tracks the person's live settings

Everything that decides *what day it is now* — Today's buckets, "completed today", relative date labels, the organizer's default calendar — reads `Calendar.autoupdatingCurrent`. A plain `Calendar.current` is a snapshot taken when it was read, so a process that stayed alive through a flight, a manual time-zone change, or a calendar-preference change would keep classifying against the old settings.

The one deliberate exception is resolving a notification trigger. `ReminderScheduler` pins a concrete `TimeZone.current` into the trigger's components at scheduling time, precisely so the fire instant cannot drift afterwards. An autoupdating zone there would reintroduce the drift the pinning exists to prevent. The rule is: autoupdating for reading the present, concrete for fixing a moment in the future.

## 2026-08-14 — Wording that names no single instant asks instead of guessing

Two cases used to resolve silently into a time nobody said.

A spring-forward gap: "tomorrow at 2:30 AM" on a day whose 2:30 AM does not exist. `Calendar.date(bySettingHour:…)` slides past the gap, so the person would have been shown 3:00 AM and a notification would have fired at a time they never chose. The resolved instant is now checked against the wall clock that was asked for, and a mismatch goes to Needs review.

A bare past hour: "remind me at 8", said at 9:30 PM. Both 8 AM and 8 PM have gone, so scheduling tomorrow at 8 AM guesses at the half of the day *and* the day. That also goes to Needs review. An explicit meridiem is different — "8 PM" names one time of day, so rolling to the next 8 PM is not a guess and still resolves silently.

Fall-back ambiguity, where 1:30 AM happens twice, resolves to the first occurrence. That is now stated in code as `repeatedTimePolicy: .first` rather than inherited from a Foundation default that could change.

## 2026-08-14 — Foreground reconciles rather than trusting the last write

SwiftData and `UNUserNotificationCenter` are two stores that can disagree: a scheduling call that failed, a crash between saving and scheduling, notifications revoked in Settings, or a request orphaned by an edit. Rather than tracking which of those happened, every foreground rebuilds the pending set from the saved items and re-reads notification authorization. One cheap pass repairs all of them, and the app never has to be right the first time to end up right.

## 2026-08-14 — Schema V2: a time expression is stored as what it meant

`dueDate: Date?` was carrying at least five different meanings at once. "Tomorrow", "tomorrow at 3", "in one hour", "every day at 9", and "every 24 hours" all collapsed into one instant, and every feature downstream had to guess which one it had been. The guesses were wrong in ways that showed: "buy milk tomorrow" resolved to 9 AM and read as overdue at 9:01 the next morning, for a task that was never due at a time at all.

`TemporalIntent` now records the kind (`dateOnly`, `exactDateTime`, `relativeDuration`, `calendarRecurrence`, `durationRecurrence`), the components the person actually supplied, and the time-zone identifier and behavior. The resolved instants stay in `dueDate` and `reminderDate` — they remain what Today sorts by and what notifications fire at — so the intent is added meaning rather than a replacement. Interpretation now happens before resolution, and both are kept.

The single rule the type exists to enforce: **never add temporal precision the person did not express.** A day stays a day. A date-only reminder still needs a moment to alert at, and that moment is derived for the notification without ever being written back into the intent, so the item still knows no hour was given.

Two kinds of recurrence are now genuinely different. "Every day at 9 AM" finds the next local 9 AM; "every 24 hours" adds exactly 86,400 seconds. They agree on ordinary days and diverge in opposite directions across the two daylight-saving transitions, which is tested in both directions.

The intent is stored encoded in one attribute rather than as a dozen columns, because nothing queries its interior — the resolved dates cover every predicate the app makes — and a blob lets the shape evolve without another schema version. `temporalKindRawValue` is denormalized beside it because every Today row reads it.

## 2026-08-14 — Version 1 is frozen in `SchemaV1.swift`

Migration needs a real predecessor. When every version points at the live model classes, bumping the version silently redefines history too and the plan ends up comparing a schema against itself. `SpeakItSchemaV1` is therefore a frozen snapshot of the three models exactly as they were stored, never instantiated by the app and never to be edited — changing a field there would rewrite the past and could make an existing device's store unreachable.

The stage itself is lightweight, because version 2 only adds optional attributes: no row is rewritten and no existing value is read. What those columns *mean* for older rows is filled in afterwards by `backfillTemporalIntents()`, deliberately outside the migration, because that pass is idempotent and resumable and a migration stage is neither.

The backfill reconstructs intent by reparsing `originalTextSegment` against the item's own `createdAt` — possible only because Speak It never discards what a person actually said, which is the clearest payoff yet from that rule. It trusts the reparse only when the recovered day matches the day already stored; a mismatch means the date was edited by hand after capture, and the stored row wins. Resolved dates are never rewritten, so no existing reminder moves because the app learned to describe it better.

Verified against a real version-1 store on the simulator: 17 items and 15 sessions before, the same 17 and 15 after, with both new columns present and every row's intent recovered.

## 2026-08-14 — Unsupported is not ambiguous

"When I get home" is understood perfectly. Speak It knows exactly what was asked for and simply cannot schedule that kind of trigger yet. Storing that as ambiguity would have produced the wrong sentence in front of the person — "what did you mean?" instead of "place reminders aren't supported yet" — so `UnsupportedTrigger` is recorded on the intent and `ClarificationRequirement.unsupportedLocationTrigger` reads from it. A genuinely ambiguous date ("4/5") keeps the questioning phrasing, because there the question is real.

The same principle sharpened the numeric-date rule. "13/5" and "5/13" are not ambiguous at all — 13 cannot be a month, so the order is forced whatever the locale prefers. Flagging them would have been asking a question with only one answer. Only two numbers that could each be a month are genuinely undecidable.

## 2026-08-14 — A recurring series repeats at the clock it was asked for

Adding a calendar day across a spring-forward silently moves the time: "every day at 2:30 AM" resolves to 3:30 on the transition day. The worse half of that bug is what happens next — the following occurrence is computed from the drifted instant, so the series adopts 3:30 permanently after one transition. A single ambiguous day rewrites the reminder forever.

`RecurrenceRule.nextDate` now takes the intended wall clock from the item's `TemporalIntent` and re-snaps every occurrence onto it, which makes the two ambiguous cases explicit policy rather than emergent behavior:

- **A time that does not exist** (2:30 AM on a spring-forward day) fires at the first moment that does, 3:00 AM, and returns to 2:30 the next day. Not skipped, not an hour late, not permanent.
- **A time that happens twice** (1:30 AM on a fall-back day) fires once, at the first occurrence — a 24-hour gap rather than 25.

Both are tested, and so is the drift itself: one test deliberately omits the intended clock and asserts the series lands on 3:00 forever, so the parameter cannot quietly become decorative.

## 2026-08-14 — Provenance and truth are different fields

An item now carries three things: the original wording, the temporal intent, and the resolved dates. When someone opens the date picker and chooses August 20 at 4 PM, they have said something more precise than any sentence could, and the sentence must stop being authoritative — otherwise "Call Catherine tomorrow" stays `dateOnly` and the row hides the 4 PM they explicitly set.

Editing therefore rebuilds the intent from the edit and marks it `isUserEdited`. The original wording is never touched; it stays in `originalTextSegment` and in the capture session as provenance. The backfill only ever visits rows with no intent at all, so no later reparse can revert a correction.

## 2026-08-14 — A calendar date survives travel because it is stored as a date

`dateOnly` items are bucketed by their recorded `CalendarDay`, not by the instant in `dueDate`. Toronto's midnight on August 15 is the afternoon of August 14 in Los Angeles, so reading the instant would have moved the item a day backwards for someone flying west — the exact failure the `CalendarDay` type exists to prevent. "August 15" means August 15 wherever the person is standing, and that is now tested in four zones and in both directions of travel.

## 2026-08-14 — Every occurrence of a series carries the series' intent

Full-path QA found that `preferredWallClock` was correct everywhere it was passed, and simply never arrived. Completing a recurring item generates the next occurrence, and that generated `CapturedItem` was built without a `temporalIntent`. The first completion still worked, because the *original* item was there to read the intended clock from. From the second occurrence onward there was nothing to read, `nextDate` fell back to deriving each occurrence from the previous resolved instant, and one daylight-saving nudge became the series' new time forever — "every day at 2:30 AM" silently becoming "every day at 3:00 AM".

Every isolated test passed throughout, because they all handed `preferredWallClock` in directly. The failure lived in the wiring, not in the resolver, and only a test that drove the real repository across a real transition could see it. `SwiftDataThoughtRepository.carriedIntent(from:toOccurrenceOn:)` now copies the intent onto each generated occurrence, advancing only `day` — and advancing it in the intent's *own* calendar, so a series pinned to a named zone keeps counting that zone's days rather than the travelling device's.

The lesson generalizes past this bug: a value object can be provably correct and still never be delivered. Correctness of a temporal system is a property of the path, not of the resolver.

## 2026-08-14 — Temporal invariants, asserted rather than intended

Three rules are now treated as architectural invariants with tests that fail loudly rather than as comments that decay:

- **Resolving an intent never modifies the intent.** `TemporalResolver.resolve` and `nextOccurrence` are pure reads, asserted over every `TemporalKind` and both reminder settings. The 9 AM date-only alert hour is the standing temptation here: it is a property of the *notification* and is derived at resolution time, never written back.
- **The next occurrence of a calendar recurrence is computed from the intended wall clock, never from the previous resolved instant.** This is what the preceding decision restored end to end.
- **Speak It never adds temporal precision the person did not express.** "Tomorrow" is not midnight and not 9 AM; "every day at 9" is not "every 24 hours"; "9 AM London time" is not 9 AM wherever the device happens to be.

The fixed-versus-device-local distinction stays automatic and unsurfaced. A bare "9 AM" is `deviceLocal` and follows the person; a named zone is `fixed` and travels with the request. There is no settings toggle, because no one has asked for one and the defaults are right.

## 2026-08-14 — A place is a second trigger, not a second kind of time

Location reminders are built as a sibling of the temporal system, not an
extension of it. `ReminderTrigger` is `.time(TemporalIntent)` or
`.location(LocationIntent)`, and the two share almost nothing: different
resolution, different permission, different failure modes, different
reconciliation. Adding `.location` as another `TemporalKind` would have grown a
branch in every temporal code path that could not mean anything — there is no
wall clock for "when I get home", no daylight-saving policy, and no next
occurrence to compute from a previous instant.

What the two *do* share is the shape of the pipeline, and that shape is the part
worth copying:

```text
TemporalIntent → resolved Date   → UNNotificationRequest
LocationIntent → resolved region → CLCircularRegion
```

## 2026-08-14 — Meaning, resolution, and permission are three separate things

`PlaceReference` records what the person meant — `.home`, `.work`,
`.currentLocation`, `.named("costco")` — and never collapses to coordinates.
`ResolvedPlace` records how that currently resolves, and is disposable. Someone
who moves house has not edited any of their reminders: `.home` still means home,
`SavedPlaceStore` returns a new coordinate, and the next reconcile follows them.
Freezing "home" into a latitude at capture time would have thrown away the one
piece of information needed to do that.

Permission is the third thing, and it is **never persisted**. A reminder that was
authorized yesterday and denied today still means "remind me when I get home".
Writing the authorization beside the intent would freeze a fact about the device
into a fact about the request, and something would then have to decide which was
stale. `LocationAuthorization` is queried at reconcile time and passed in.

Losing permission therefore never deletes or disables a reminder. It changes only
what the app can currently do about it, and the reminder reports
`LocationReminderBlocker.permissionRevoked` until access returns.

## 2026-08-14 — Location failures are distinguished, not pooled

`LocationReminderBlocker` has eleven cases and a test asserting that no two of
them produce the same sentence. "When I get home" with no Home configured says
*Set your Home location*, never *What did you mean?* — the same principle that
made "unsupported" distinct from "ambiguous" in the first place, applied to a
feature that now exists. A place reminder that is understood and configured is
not a review item at all; the only location case that genuinely belongs in review
is a sentence whose place could not be read.

## 2026-08-14 — "Here" is a snapshot; Home is a pointer

The two look alike and behave oppositely, so the difference is worth stating.
`.home` is a *pointer*: it means "wherever home is now", and moving house
re-resolves every reminder that mentions it without editing any of them.
`.currentLocation` is a *snapshot*: the coordinate is the meaning. "Remind me
when I leave here", said at McMaster and carried to Toronto, must still mean
McMaster. Re-resolving it would silently rewrite the request into "wherever I
happen to be", which is not a reminder at all.

So it is resolved exactly once, just after the capture is durable, and never
again. Three consequences follow deliberately:

- **Capture never waits on it.** The fix is fire-and-forget. A location read can
  take seconds or never arrive, and capture durability outranks it. An
  unresolved "here" reports `locationUnavailable` — honest and recoverable —
  rather than a wrong coordinate.
- **A cached fix is preferred to a fresh one.** Counter-intuitive, but a fix iOS
  already holds is *closer in time to the moment the words were said*. Requesting
  a new one can take long enough for the person to walk out of the region.
- **Naming is opt-in, never automatic.** Reverse-geocoding would send the exact
  coordinate to Apple for a purely cosmetic label — the one location call the
  person never asked for, on the one path that is otherwise entirely on-device:
  speak a thought, freeze a coordinate, monitor a region, no network at all.
  "when you leave here" is already legible, so the label is not worth
  transmitting a position for. The editor offers **Name this place** instead,
  which makes the lookup the person's to initiate. Home/Work address search is
  different and stays automatic, because there the person typed the query.

- **A cached fix must be a *suitable* cached fix.** A `CLLocation` exists almost
  always; one 27 minutes old and accurate to ±1.4km is not where the person is
  standing, and accepting it because it was non-nil would pin the region onto
  the wrong neighbourhood. `CurrentLocationProvider.isSuitable` requires an age
  within 120s and accuracy within 100m, rejects CoreLocation's negative
  "invalid" accuracy, and rejects a fix dated in the future whose real age is
  unknowable. The same floor screens freshly delivered fixes — "just arrived" is
  not evidence of "good enough", since a first indoor fix can be kilometres
  wide. The accuracy bound is tied to `ResolvedPlace.defaultRadius` by test, so
  a looser fix can never place the pin outside the region it marks.

## 2026-08-14 — Permission escalates with the action, not with the screen

Core Location has two levels and Speak It needs both, at different moments.
Setting Home from your current position, and freezing "here", are single
foreground reads — `CurrentLocationProvider` asks for When In Use and stops
there. Arming a persistent arrive/leave reminder is the only thing that needs
the app woken while closed, and that is the one place the Always prompt is
raised, with copy that says why before iOS asks.

Opening Places therefore never triggers the strongest prompt. The escalation is
tied to the capability being used, not to a screen being visited.

One platform constraint shapes the UI: **iOS shows the Always upgrade prompt once
per install.** Every later `requestAlwaysAuthorization()` returns silently, so a
button wired straight to it becomes a control that visibly does nothing.
`LocationReminderMonitor.authorizationStep` records that the ask has been spent
and switches the affordance to "Open Settings". That flag records what the *app
asked*, not what the system granted — it is not a cached permission, and
`LocationAuthorization` is still queried fresh every time.

## 2026-08-14 — What the Privacy screen may claim about location

The screen says location stays on the device, is never sent to analytics, and is
not in iCloud Sync. Each was checked against the implementation rather than
assumed: `AnalyticsService`'s vocabulary contains no location term, and
`ICloudItemSnapshot` has no location field, so a place reminder is not synced.

It also says, because it is true, that address search and place naming ask Apple
Maps. `MKLocalSearch` and `CLGeocoder` are network calls; the query or the
coordinate goes to Apple. Claiming "nothing leaves your iPhone" without that
sentence would have been false. Note that naming a captured "here" sends a
coordinate to Apple automatically — the one location call the person does not
explicitly initiate, which is precisely why it is disclosed.

`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` is unchanged and correct: `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes`
describes what the *developer* collects, and Speak It collects no location.

## 2026-08-14 — The fix for a blocked place reminder lives beside the reminder

`Settings → Capture & reminders → Places` sets Home and Work, but it is not the
only way in. A reminder blocked on `missingHome` offers **Set Home location**
inside the editor it is already open in, pushes the same picker, and re-resolves
on return via `SavedPlaceStore.didChangeNotification`. Permission blockers get
the same treatment: the one that can be granted in-app has a button, and the one
that cannot says "Open Settings" rather than pretending otherwise.

Making the settings screen the only route would have meant leaving the thought,
finding a setting, and coming back to it — for a gap the app had just named on
screen. The blocker enum already distinguishes eleven reasons; this makes each
one's answer reachable from where the person actually is.

Note the asymmetry that stays: setting Home changes a *resolution*, so it is
global and every reminder follows it. Nothing about the reminder is edited.

## 2026-08-14 — Location usage strings must live in the real Info.plist

The project sets `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO` and points at a checked-in
`SpeakIt/Info.plist`. Under that setting Xcode ignores every `INFOPLIST_KEY_*`
build setting, so the two `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSLocation*` values in `project.pbxproj`
never reached the built app. Without `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` iOS
does not show the permission prompt at all, which meant no place reminder could
ever have been authorized on a device.

Nothing in Swift could fail this way, so `testTheBuiltAppDeclaresItsLocationUsage`
asserts the keys against `Bundle.main` — the built product — rather than the
source. Any future permission Speak It adds should be checked the same way.

## 2026-08-14 — A place and a time together are held, not halved

"Remind me to take out the garbage when I get home tonight" constrains both a
place and a time, and Speak It can enforce exactly one of them. The original
design kept both halves live and let each fire on its own, which was verified to
schedule the 8pm notification *and* monitor the region — the reminder would
arrive at 8pm regardless of location, and again on arrival. Preferring the place
was the alternative, and it is wrong in the other direction: it fires on a 2pm
arrival that "tonight" ruled out. Preferring the time discards the place the
person named.

There is no correct half. So the combination is stored in full, excluded from
both schedulers, and surfaced as `ClarificationRequirement.combinedTimeAndPlace`
— *"Place and time conditions aren't supported together yet — choose one"* —
with a time set in the editor counting as committing to the clock half. The day
is still kept on the intent, so real narrowing can be added later without the
sentence being re-captured.

This is the location half of the rule the temporal side already follows: never
pretend to support semantics that are not being enforced. It is also a
prerequisite for Home/Work configuration rather than a follow-up to it — the
double-fire was latent only because no Home can currently be set, and shipping
that UI would have activated it.

## 2026-08-14 — Version 2 had to be frozen before version 3 could exist

`SpeakItSchemaV2` was originally declared in terms of the live model classes.
That was invisible while version 2 was newest — the live shape and the version 2
shape were the same object. Adding an attribute to the live `CapturedItem` for
version 3 silently redefined version 2 to include it too, both versions in the
migration plan described the same schema, and opening any existing store aborted
inside CoreData on launch.

Version 2 now carries its own frozen snapshot, exactly as version 1 does. The
rule the V1 file already stated turns out to apply to every version and not just
the first: a schema version can only describe the past if it owns a copy of it.
